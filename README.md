## Beginner ideas
- Change the color of the wall
- Change the color of the player
- Use the console to change player.color, player.height, etc.
- When you hit the wall, make the message say "You win!"
- Customize the Game Over message
- Add a second wall
- Does canvas have an API for interacting with it / changing things via the console?

## More advanced ideas

- When the player hits the floor or ceiling, start them at the other side instead of game over
- cheat code to turn off game over
